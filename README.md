## Stock Market Prediction using LSTM

### Overview
This project aims to predict stock market prices using LSTM neural networks. LSTM networks are well-suited for time series data like stock prices due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies. By leveraging historical stock data, this model attempts to forecast future prices, enabling users to make informed investment decisions.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Raw stock market data is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize the data, and create suitable input-output sequences for training the LSTM model.
2. **Model Architecture**: LSTM neural network architecture is employed to learn patterns from historical stock data. The model consists of multiple LSTM layers followed by fully connected layers for prediction.
3. **Training**: The model is trained using historical stock data, optimizing performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
4. **Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on test data to assess its predictive accuracy. Metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are computed to quantify the model's performance.
5. **Prediction**: Finally, the model is utilized to make predictions on unseen data, providing insights into future stock price movements.

### Usage
1. **Data Collection**: Obtain historical stock market data for the desired stocks using APIs or data sources.
2. **Preprocessing**: Preprocess the data to handle missing values, scale features, and create input-output sequences.
3. **Training**: Train the LSTM model using the preprocessed data.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using test data and relevant evaluation metrics.
5. **Prediction**: Utilize the trained model to predict future stock prices.
